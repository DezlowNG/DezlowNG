Hello, my name is Nikita, I was born in the city of Krasnoyarsk (Russia) and I love programming in C++ (seriously), and I also love listening to music and playing games (rarely, since this is a waste of time IMHO).
Now I study computer graphics and everything related to it, as I want to write my own game engine in the future. I hope I succeed :)
